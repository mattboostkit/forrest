# Forrest HR Website Project Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the changes made to prepare the Forrest HR website for deployment to Vercel and running the blog from Sanity. It also outlines the next steps for implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sanity Configuration Consolidation

- Identified the `forrest/` directory as the primary Sanity Studio configuration
- Updated `package.json` scripts to point to the `forrest/` directory:
  ```json
  "sanity": "cd forrest && npm run dev",
  "sanity:build": "cd forrest && npm run build",
  "sanity:deploy": "cd forrest && npm run deploy"
  ```
- Removed redundant Sanity scripts that pointed to the `studio/` directory

### 2. Vercel Deployment Configuration

- Created `vercel.json` with appropriate settings:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "buildCommand": "npm run build && cd forrest && npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "dist",
    "framework": "vite",
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/(.*)",
        "headers": [
          { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
          { "key": "X-XSS-Protection", "value": "1; mode=block" },
          { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
          { "key": "Referrer-Policy", "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
          { "key": "Content-Security-Policy", "value": "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://cdn.sanity.io; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 3. CORS Configuration Script

- Created `scripts/setup-vercel-cors.js` to help configure CORS for Vercel deployment
- The script automates:
  - Sanity CLI installation check
  - Sanity login
  - Adding Vercel domain to allowed CORS origins
  - Setting up environment variables

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- **Vercel Deployment Guide** (`docs/vercel-deployment-guide.md`): Step-by-step instructions for deploying to Vercel
- **SEO Enhancement Plan** (`docs/seo-enhancement-plan.md`): Detailed strategy for improving search rankings
- **Design Modernization Plan** (`docs/design-modernization.md`): Recommendations for enhancing the visual design
- **Project Summary** (`docs/project-summary.md`): This document

### 5. Updated README

- Updated `README.md` with project overview, structure, and instructions
- Added links to documentation
